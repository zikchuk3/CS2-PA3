Design Thinking Final Passion Project

## Empathize: 
- A mother/father who relies on SNAP benefits to feed their family is struggling to find places where they can get food due to the government shutdown cuts

## Research:
1. Title: What’s happening with SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown? https://youtu.be/1cV6oaLcDRk?si=qgvQ_O74ch6IyMlx
2. Title: Nearly 42 million Americans lose their food stamp benefits 
    highlight from it: "For now, states, food banks and nonprofit organizations are scrambling to backfill the loss of critical federal dollars, however temporary it may be, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday." https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/01/millions-lose-food-aid-snap-trump-shutdown-00632404
3. Title: Trump administration must continue food aid during shutdown, US judges say
    highlight from it: "Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families"  https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr433x9zqq4o
4. Title: Military families turn to food banks as shutdown hits SNAP benefits https://youtu.be/HQQX9UrOsn4?si=rbLbVYKNsi8mT9AE

## Define: 
- How might I help an individual learn about food banks/pantrys/non-profits where they can be provided food after the government shutdown cut on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program?

# Reflection
### Problems I faced
    - I was struggling to add thing to bookmark.txt once instead of twice if the user types the same name in, I had to add \n to the things
    - I tried to add a delete bookmark feauture where it will delete a certain bookmark instead of clearing the whole file, I might've been able to do it but I didn't have enough time so I gave it up 
    - Before I used the json file, I tried to use multiple dictionaries for the info, but it was just not working the way I wanted it to, so I switched to the json
    - I struggled to find where I could use a dictionary after I switched to the json but I eventually just used it for the menu
    - I struggled with the try/except error handling in the show_list func because of the range of thing for chosen_bookmarn but I figured it out by just calling the show_list func again then return to main after


### What I'm most proud of
    - I am proud of being to put everything I learnt this mod together
    - I think my idea is good and if I had more time it could be even more

### What I would add/change
    - I would add more cities/towns and more places 
    - maybe make it by county instead of cities too
    - add more states
    - add a summary when displaying info (I had it before but deleted it due to not having enough time </3)
    - add the delete bookmark option (I ran out of time)

### Pledge
    I did not give nor receive aid on this assignment with the exception of these sources:
    - json files: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp + https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/read-json-file-using-python/
    - isdigit(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isdigit.asp
    - join(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp
    - mardown for readme: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/

### Peer Review
    -My mom was my peer reviewer and she made me realize that some of my instructions weren't clear enough, so I made them cleaer
    -Also made it so it allowed user to type in stuff like 'dc' for the menu instead of just numbers
