Design Thinking Final Passion Project

## Empathize: 
- A mother/father who relies on SNAP benefits to feed their family is struggling to find places where they can get food due to the government shutdown cuts

## Research:
1. Title: What’s happening with SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown? https://youtu.be/1cV6oaLcDRk?si=qgvQ_O74ch6IyMlx
2. Title: Nearly 42 million Americans lose their food stamp benefits 
    highlight from it: "For now, states, food banks and nonprofit organizations are scrambling to backfill the loss of critical federal dollars, however temporary it may be, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday." https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/01/millions-lose-food-aid-snap-trump-shutdown-00632404
3. Title: Trump administration must continue food aid during shutdown, US judges say
    highlight from it: "Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families"  https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr433x9zqq4o
4. Title: Military families turn to food banks as shutdown hits SNAP benefits https://youtu.be/HQQX9UrOsn4?si=rbLbVYKNsi8mT9AE

## Define: 
- How might I help an individual learn about food banks/pantrys/non-profits where they can be provided food after the government shutdown cut on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program?

# Reflection
### Problems I faced
    - I tried to add a delete bookmark feauture where it will delete a certain bookmark instead of clearing the whole file 
    - I struggled to find where I could use a dictionary but I eventually just used it for the menu
    - other than that, I did not really face any problems

### What I'm most proud of
    - I am proud of being to put everything I learnt this mod together
    - I think my idea is good and if I had more time it could be even more

### What I would add/change
    - I would add more cities/towns and more places 
    - maybe make it by county instead of cities too
    - add a summary when displaying info (I had it before but deleted it due to not having enough time </3)
